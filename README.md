# Stepper motors 
are diverse in their uses, but some of the most common include:
- 3D printing equipment.
- Textile machines.
- Printing presses.
- Gaming machines.
- Medical imaging machinery.
- Small robotics.
- CNC milling machines.
- Welding equipment.

My use will be to start with telescope control project in https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/tec-SCOPE as well as dc motors.
Next will be the https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/tec-Plot-PCB for making PCB tracks for etching.
The https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/tec-T800 will use servo motors and there control is completely different
