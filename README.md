## Drive 
- tec1 to simulate the step code for the stepper motor
- via a step controller

## App
- https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/tec-SCOPE 
  - stepper motor
  - dc motors
- https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/tec-Plot-PCB , for making PCB tracks for etching.
- https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/tec-T800 will use servo motors and their control is completely different to steppers, they use PWM
