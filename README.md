# Stepper motors 
are diverse in their uses, but some of the most common include:
- 3D printing equipment.
- Textile machines.
- Printing presses.
- Gaming machines.
- Medical imaging machinery.
- Small robotics.
- CNC milling machines.
- Welding equipment.

My use will be to start with telescope control project in https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/tec-SCOPE as well as dc motors.
Next will be the https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/tec-Plot-PCB for making PCB tracks for etching.
The https://github.com/SteveJustin1963/tec-T800 will use servo motors and there control is completely different

### There are three basic types of stepper motors:

- Permanent Magnet Stepper. PM steppers have rotors that are constructed with permanent magnets, which interact with the electromagnets of the stator to create rotation and torque. ...
- Variable Reluctance Stepper.
- Hybrid Syncronous Stepper.
### or 
- Active rotor: permanent magnet step motor(PM)
- Reactive rotor: variable reluctance stepper motor(VR)
- Combination of VR and PM: Hybrid stepper motor (HY)
